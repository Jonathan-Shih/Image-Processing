Image Processing

This program is fully completed and meets all required functionality.

The previous code was left unmodified but for the addition of a few methods. 

The SimpleLayerManipulator received new methods to copy lists, read files, and save all layers. 

ImageUtil now supports conversion of an image to a BufferedImage. 

## Use

This version of the program includes a JAR file allowing the program to be run in 2 different modes. The JAR takes 3 possible command line arguments:

### -script "filename" 
Runs the manipulator with the given script.

### -text
Supports directly inputting commands to the text controller.

### -interactive
Launches the GUI to work interactively with images. Uses a separate controller to the text-based options.
